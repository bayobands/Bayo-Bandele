--Code Smells I Found
Bad Varibake Names
The original code used names like c, a, b, and h.
These don’t describe what the values actually store, which makes the program harder to read.
Changed Varible Name.
2. Repeated Code
All three buttons (increment, decrement, reset) repeated the same steps:
update counter display
update document title
change background color
This is classic duplicate code.
CHnaged it to where I only kept one and deleted the others.
